# password-generator

## what i was tasked to do:

in this project i was tasked with modifying a starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that they have selected. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated html and css powered by javascript. It has a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen.

## users interaction steps for app

- when a new secure password is required, then the button is clicked to generate a password
  which the user is then presented with a series of prompts for password criteria

- when prompted for password criteria, the user can select which criteria to include in the password.

- user is then prompted for the length of the password
  which they can choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters

- they are then asked for character types to include in the password
  which are lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters so the user confirms which one they would like to include.

- When the user answers each prompt Then the input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected.

- When all prompts are answered Then a password is generated that matches the selected criteria

- When the password is generated Then the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
